AI Interview Mocker
A comprehensive guide to building an AI-powered interview practice platform using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, Clerk, and Gemini API.

This project outlines the steps to create an AI Interview Mocker application that allows users to practice for interviews through simulated question-answer sessions.

Prerequisites
Node.js and npm (or yarn)
A PostgreSQL database
A Gemini API key
A Clerk account
Project Setup
1. Create Next.js App and Install Dependencies
Bash
npx create-next-app ai-interview-mocker
cd ai-interview-mocker
npm install react-router-dom tailwindcss postgreSql drizzle-orm clerk gemini-sdk
Use code with caution.

2. Configure Tailwind CSS
Follow the Tailwind CSS setup guide for your project.

3. Set Up PostgreSQL and Drizzle ORM
Create a PostgreSQL database.
Configure database connection details in your environment variables.
Define database schema and models using Drizzle ORM.
4. Integrate Clerk for Authentication
Create a Clerk account and application.
Install the Clerk Next.js SDK.
Configure Clerk authentication in your Next.js app.
5. Set Up Gemini API
Obtain a Gemini API key.
Install the Gemini SDK.
Configure the Gemini SDK with your API key.
Core Functionalities
Generate AI Interview Questions
Use the Gemini API to generate interview questions based on user-defined parameters (e.g., job role, experience level).
Store generated questions in the database for future use.
Record User Answer
Implement audio recording using the Web Audio API.
Convert recorded audio to text using a speech-to-text service (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text).
Save User Response
Store the user's answer (text format), the generated question, and other relevant metadata in the database.
Provide User Feedback
Implement a feedback mechanism based on user performance (e.g., accuracy, fluency).
Consider using NLP techniques to analyze user responses.
Additional Features
User Profiles: Allow users to create profiles, track progress, and save interview history.
Question Customization: Enable users to create and customize their own interview questions.
Mock Interview Modes: Offer different interview simulation modes (e.g., one-on-one, panel).
Performance Analytics: Provide detailed performance analytics and insights.
Deployment
Deploy the application to a cloud platform like Vercel or Netlify.
Configure environment variables for database connection, API keys, and other sensitive information.
Step-by-Step Tutorial
Create a detailed tutorial covering each step of the development process.
